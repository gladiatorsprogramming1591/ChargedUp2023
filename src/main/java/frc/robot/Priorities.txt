Main TODO:
1:  Auto Paths
        Non-balance autos
        Different autos for real and wood charge stations
        Add auto that only drives out of community after time set in SmartDashboard
        Test ALL Autos
    
Low Priority:
    Arm:
        If driving too fast, lower arm to home
    
    Drive:
        DriveToAngle: Angle could be positive or negative, need to handle both
        Should be positive if driving forward, negative if driving backward onto the power station ramp

    Research April tags with Limelight
        -New branch
        -convert swerveDriveOdometry to swerveDrivePoseEstimator
        -update swerveDrivePoseEstimator with vision targets
        -teleop auto score using April tags & vision
    
    Sensors:
        Add Sensors (1 Color and 2 Distance[for cone and cube])
        Color sensor to set motor direction, Distance to determine alignment to grid



Requires Testing:

    Autos
        -Paths with events
        -Lengthen 3 and 7 one piece auto paths into charge station
        -4/6 one cone auto level

    Turn to target speed increase, adjust PID accordingly

    Improve the intake stall (current limit increase?)
        Both improve operability (remove joystick button) and reduce motor temp

  Low Priority:
    Limelight/April Tags
        -Update limelight code

    Test Path with Events
        -Autolevel: parallel or sequential?

    Ground Intake
        -Program CANIDs for the 3 ground intake motors
        -Ground Intake w/ PID and verify current limits

    



Auto Tracker:
    Requires Testing:
        Path with events
        Everything else
    Tested:
        OneConeAuto3
        OneCubeAuto3Hybrid
        OnePieceAuto5Level 
        OnePieceAuto7





Completed:
    Add commands for ground intake
    Ground Intake PID
    Add offset constant for Arm
    Speed up arm
    Slow drive: joystick into drive subsystem 
    Instantiate Ground Intake in Container
    Program ground intake (2 Bags for both complients, 1 Neo for raising)

    Before Rally
        More auto paths
        Fix DriveToAngle: Replaced with path during auto
        PWM for LEDs 
        Switch to Absolute Encoder for Arm
