Main TODO:
-Lower LVLTWO (needs bot, used infrequently)
-TwoPieceAuto1 for blue side with slightly longer path onto chargeStation
to account for its additional wheel slip
1:  Autos
        Add auto that only drives out of community after time set in SmartDashboard
        Different autos for real and wood charge stations
        4/6 one cone auto level
        Non-balance autos

    Fix Flashing LEDs method

    Research April tags with Limelight:
        -New branch
        -convert swerveDriveOdometry to swerveDrivePoseEstimator
        -update swerveDrivePoseEstimator with vision targets
        -teleop auto score using April tags & vision 

    Ground Intake
        -Add IntakeJoint Default Command
        -IntakeHandoff
            -ArmJoint kP of PID increase
            -replace ".alongWith" with raceGroup once groundJointToPosition has a proper end.
                This way the handoff will not happen until arm is at position, and both commands end before handoff.
        -First button: onTrue - lower and run intake.    onFalse - raise arm and turn off intake.

            


Requires Testing:
    Update HOME position w/ new bar-hardstop placement

    Autos
        -Lengthen 3 and 7 one piece auto paths into charge station



Tested Autos:
    OneConeAuto3
    OneCubeAuto3Hybrid
    OnePieceAuto5Level
    OnePieceAuto6Level
    OnePieceAuto7
    TwoPieceAuto9 (needs improvement over cable protector)

(Gio) Bring to RIT:
    Power Strip
    Monidor
    Wifi Dongal



Low Priority:

    Drive:
        DriveToAngle: Angle could be positive or negative, need to handle both
        Should be positive if driving forward, negative if driving backward onto the power station ramp

    Arm:
        If driving too fast, lower arm to home
        If Arm is not at or going to kHOME, enable slow drive

    Sensors:
        Add Sensors (1 Color and 2 Distance[for cone and cube])
        Color sensor to set motor direction, Distance to determine alignment to grid

   

    








Completed:
LEDPiece and interupts arm (conestow)
    Ground Intake
        -Program CANIDs for the 3 ground intake motors
        -Ground Intake w/ PID and verify current limits
        -Confirm Speed Direction For Intake and Joint(+,-)
        Transfer button: onTrue - reverse ground intake and run main intake
    Test LED debounce
    Intake button
    Path w/ events
    Update Offset & test arm Encoder
    Inverted Encoder Logic
    Add commands for ground intake
    Ground Intake PID
    Add offset constant for Arm
    Speed up arm
    Slow drive: joystick into drive subsystem 
    Instantiate Ground Intake in Container
    Program ground intake (2 Bags for both complients, 1 Neo for raising)

    Before Rally
        More auto paths
        Fix DriveToAngle: Replaced with path during auto
        PWM for LEDs 
        Switch to Absolute Encoder for Arm
