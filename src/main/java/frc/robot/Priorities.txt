Main TODO:
-Ground intake shoot button (Shoot pos method needs improvment)
-Go through 'TODOs'
-Set reminder to straighten out modules before running any auto (Systems Check Responsibility)
TEST: Manual Ground/Arm button debounce and corresponding LEDs

Sensors & 3D printed parts:
    Add Distance Sensor to determine alignment to grid
    -Invesitgate limelight low mount

Current(Amps):
    -Use current to know if cube is picked-up during auto
        (eg. if current > "5" while intake running at any point, continue auto. else, ...)
    -If main or ground intake current > "5", flash LEDs some color

-Vision:
    -Look for more reflective tape (Warehouse?)
    -Limelight currently locked on level 2 position
    -Switch target filtering ("debouce")
        idea: Update change in "txPast" to update approximate target tx relative to pasttx (delta)
                -Update sorting OR get smartTargets working to choose desired peg
        idea 2: Use Area? Delta of ty?
    -Target sorting
    -Adjust Limelight prioritization of targets via its web interface
    -Add Vision PID straff alignment to nodes (square up to grid using nodes 2 & 3 tx offsets from each other)
    
-Lower LVLTWO (needs bot, used infrequently)

to account for its additional wheel slip
1:  Autos
        New autos over cable protector:
            AUTO DESCRIPTION                                                    GOAL                POINTS      OPENING DURATION
        -Score 1 high w/ +1 and balance                                     (for Score)    (6+(8-12)+5 = 19-23p)    (~15+3s)
        -Score hybrid then shoot 2 cubes into community to link             (for RP)           (3+2+2+[5] = 12p)    (~15+5s)
        -Score 1 high, shoot 1 to community, race nearest Loading Zone      (for LVL3)         (6+5+5+[5] = 21p)    (~15+7s)

        -Improve C9OneConeShootTwo Auto's speed (by seperating cable-protector path)

        -Arm down parallel to joint out timing needs improvement
        -Add auto that only drives out of community after time set in SmartDashboard


April Tags:
    -Treat as reflective target and use distance/ty to balance?

            


Requires Testing:
    Vision
        confirm if 2nd level node reflective tape is visible on chargeStation
    Autos
        -Lengthen 3 and 7 one piece auto paths into charge station
        TwoPieceAuto1 for blue side with slightly longer path onto chargeStation (address RIT instance)



Tested Autos:
    OneConeScoreSolo
    OneCubeScoreSolo
    C3OneCone
    C3OneCubeHybrid
    C5OneCubeLevel
    C4C6OneConeLevel
    C7OneCone
    C9TwoPiece (+balance)
    C9OneConeShootTwo




Low Priority:
Research April tags with Limelight:
    -New branch
    -convert swerveDriveOdometry to swerveDrivePoseEstimator
    -update swerveDrivePoseEstimator with vision targets
    -teleop auto score using April tags & vision 

    -Different autos for real and wood charge stations

    Arm:
        If Arm is not at or going to kHOME, enable slow drive

    Sensors:
        Add Sensors (1 Color and 2 Distance[for cone and cube])
        Color sensor to set motor direction, Distance to determine alignment to grid

   

    








Completed:
New autos over cable protector:
        AUTO DESCRIPTION                                                    GOAL                POINTS      OPENING DURATION
    -Score 2 high                                                       (for LVL3)               (6+6 = 12p)    (~15s)
    -Score 1 high then shoot 2 cubes into hybrid                        (for LVL3)             (6+5+5 = 16p)    (~15+10s)
-Speed up autonomous
    -Single path for 'cone reverse' + 'drive to cube' while keeping marker (for HOME and intakeOff) in same spot
        or sooner with higher accel/speed
Fix Flashing LEDs method
Vision:
    -Test vision rot scoring
    -PID value changes by large amount, ignore for second to give time for original target to return (debounce)
        (Limelight target validity for when target is lost for breif moment (2 small deadzones when arm LVLTRE))
    -Finish Vision PID rot alignment to nodes
Ground Intake
    -Add IntakeJoint Default Command
    -IntakeHandoff
        -ArmJoint kP of PID increase
        -replace ".alongWith" with raceGroup once groundJointToPosition has a proper end.
            This way the handoff will not happen until arm is at position, and both commands end before handoff.
    -First button: onTrue - lower and run intake.    onFalse - raise arm and turn off intake.
-Change Limelight to Cam Mode
Update HOME position w/ new bar-hardstop placement
LEDPiece and interupts arm (conestow)
-4/6 one cone auto level
    Ground Intake
        -Program CANIDs for the 3 ground intake motors
        -Ground Intake w/ PID and verify current limits
        -Confirm Speed Direction For Intake and Joint(+,-)
        Transfer button: onTrue - reverse ground intake and run main intake
    Test LED debounce
    Intake button
    Path w/ events
    Update Offset & test arm Encoder
    Inverted Encoder Logic
    Add commands for ground intake
    Ground Intake PID
    Add offset constant for Arm
    Speed up arm
    Slow drive: joystick into drive subsystem 
    Instantiate Ground Intake in Container
    Program ground intake (2 Bags for both complients, 1 Neo for raising)

    Before Rally
        More auto paths
        Fix DriveToAngle: Replaced with path during auto
        PWM for LEDs 
        Switch to Absolute Encoder for Arm
