Main TODO:
    Ground Intake
        Add commands for ground intake
        Ground Intake PID
    Auto Paths
        Non-balance autos
        Different autos for real and wood charge stations 
    Research April tags with Limelight
        -Update limelight code
        -New branch
        -convert swerveDriveOdometry to swerveDrivePoseEstimator
        -update swerveDrivePoseEstimator with vision targets
        -teleop auto score using April tags & vision
    Java 17 to 11 (?is already 11 in build.gradle?)




Requires Testing:
    Turn to target speed increase
    Add offset constant for Arm
    Program CANIDs for the 3 ground intake motors
    Ground Intake w/ PID and verify current limits
    Lengthen 3 and 7 one piece auto paths into charge station
    Improve the intake stall (current limit increase?)
        Both improve operability (remove joystick button) and reduce motor temp







Completed:
    Speed up arm
    Slow drive: joystick into drive subsystem 
    Instantiate Ground Intake in Container
    Program ground intake (2 Bags for both complients, 1 Neo for raising)

    Before Rally
        More auto paths
        Fix DriveToAngle: Replaced with path during auto
        PWM for LEDs 
        Switch to Absolute Encoder for Arm
