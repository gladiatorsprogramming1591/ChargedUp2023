Main TODO:
    Speed up driving

1:  Autos
        Add auto that only drives out of community after time set in SmartDashboard
        Different autos for real and wood charge stations
        4/6 one cone auto level
        Non-balance autos

    Research April tags with Limelight:
        -New branch
        -convert swerveDriveOdometry to swerveDrivePoseEstimator
        -update swerveDrivePoseEstimator with vision targets
        -teleop auto score using April tags & vision 

    Ground Intake
        First button: onTrue - lower and run intake.    onFalse - raise arm and turn off intake.
        Transfer button: onTrue - reverse ground intake and run main intake


Requires Testing:
    Test LED debounce

    Ground Intake
        -Program CANIDs for the 3 ground intake motors
        -Ground Intake w/ PID and verify current limits
        -Confirm Speed Direction For Intake and Joint(+,-)

    Autos
        -Lengthen 3 and 7 one piece auto paths into charge station



Tested Autos:
    OneConeAuto3
    OneCubeAuto3Hybrid
    OnePieceAuto5Level
    OnePieceAuto6Level
    OnePieceAuto7
    TwoPieceAuto9 (needs improvement over cable protector)



Low Priority:

    Drive:
        DriveToAngle: Angle could be positive or negative, need to handle both
        Should be positive if driving forward, negative if driving backward onto the power station ramp

    Arm:
        If driving too fast, lower arm to home
        If Arm is not at or going to kHOME, enable slow drive

    Sensors:
        Add Sensors (1 Color and 2 Distance[for cone and cube])
        Color sensor to set motor direction, Distance to determine alignment to grid

   

    








Completed:
    Intake button
    Path w/ events
    Update Offset & test arm Encoder
    Inverted Encoder Logic
    Add commands for ground intake
    Ground Intake PID
    Add offset constant for Arm
    Speed up arm
    Slow drive: joystick into drive subsystem 
    Instantiate Ground Intake in Container
    Program ground intake (2 Bags for both complients, 1 Neo for raising)

    Before Rally
        More auto paths
        Fix DriveToAngle: Replaced with path during auto
        PWM for LEDs 
        Switch to Absolute Encoder for Arm
