Main TODO:
    Slow drive: joystick into drive subsystem 
    Add commands for ground intake
    Ground Intake PID
    Non-balance autos
    April tags 
    Different autos for real and wood charge stations 
    Speed up arm
    Java 17 to 11 (?is already 11 in build.gradle?)



Requires Testing:
    Program CANIDs for the 3 ground intake motors
    Ground Intake w/ PID and verify current limits
    Lengthen 3 and 7 one piece auto paths into charge station
    Improve the intake stall (current limit increase?) Both improve operability (remove joystick button) and reduce motor temp










Completed:
    Instantiate Ground Intake in Container
    Program ground intake (2 Bags for both complients, 1 Neo for raising)

    Before Rally
        More auto paths
        Fix DriveToAngle: Replaced with path during auto
        PWM for LEDs 
        Switch to Absolute Encoder for Arm
