Main TODO:
1:  Autos
        Path w/ events 
        Non-balance autos
        Different autos for real and wood charge stations
        Add auto that only drives out of community after time set in SmartDashboard
        Test ALL Autos


Requires Testing:
    ***Update Offset & test arm Encoder
    Autos
        -Paths with events
            -Autolevel parallel or sequential?
        -Lengthen 3 and 7 one piece auto paths into charge station
        -4/6 one cone auto level

    Turn to target speed increase, adjust PID accordingly

    Improve the intake stall (current limit increase?)
        Both improve operability (remove joystick button) and reduce motor temp


Tested Autos:
    OneConeAuto3
    OneCubeAuto3Hybrid
    OnePieceAuto5Level
    OnePieceAuto6Level
    OnePieceAuto7
    TwoPieceAuto9 (needs improvement over cable protector)



Low Priority:

    Drive:
        DriveToAngle: Angle could be positive or negative, need to handle both
        Should be positive if driving forward, negative if driving backward onto the power station ramp

    Research April tags with Limelight:
        -New branch
        -convert swerveDriveOdometry to swerveDrivePoseEstimator
        -update swerveDrivePoseEstimator with vision targets
        -teleop auto score using April tags & vision

    Arm:
        If driving too fast, lower arm to home
        
    Sensors:
        Add Sensors (1 Color and 2 Distance[for cone and cube])
        Color sensor to set motor direction, Distance to determine alignment to grid

    Ground Intake
        -Program CANIDs for the 3 ground intake motors
        -Ground Intake w/ PID and verify current limits

    








Completed:
    Inverted Encoder Logic
    Add commands for ground intake
    Ground Intake PID
    Add offset constant for Arm
    Speed up arm
    Slow drive: joystick into drive subsystem 
    Instantiate Ground Intake in Container
    Program ground intake (2 Bags for both complients, 1 Neo for raising)

    Before Rally
        More auto paths
        Fix DriveToAngle: Replaced with path during auto
        PWM for LEDs 
        Switch to Absolute Encoder for Arm
